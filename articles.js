		"Former President Donald Trump pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with a $130,000 hush money payment made in the final days of the 2016 presidential campaign to prevent an adult film star from disclosing an affair she says she had with him.",
		"Trump's arrest and appearance in a New York courtroom begin a long legal process, and District Attorney Alvin Bragg's legal theory of the case remains unclear.",
		"But Fox News propagandists and other Trumpist commentators have predetermined that Trump is the victim of a politicized persecution that threatens the American justice system — and they're suggesting that Republicans respond in kind.",
		"Some argue that Trump will explicitly order politicized prosecutions if he wins the presidency in 2024.",
		"\"If Donald Trump runs and wins, he's going to indict Joe Biden and the entire Biden crew,\" Fox host Jesse Watters said on Tuesday night. \"So Biden might have to run and win because if he doesn't, you know those indictments are coming. It's not like Trump's going to let this thing go\".",
		"Others think the retaliatory prosecutions should begin sooner.",
		"\"Here's what I hope happens next,\" former Bush White House press secretary and Fox contributor Ari Fleischer told Sean Hannity later that night.",
		"\"I earnestly hope that conservative prosecutors in rural areas of America indict Bill Clinton, indict Hillary Clinton, indict Hunter Biden\".",
		"\"If this is allowed to stand and continue, then, you know, watch out, because there's going to be a time and a place where Republicans, they'll get their revenge, too,\" Hannity said on his radio show.",
		"\"And there'll be some Democrat and they'll be going after them for spitting on the sidewalk and jaywalking, because that's basically what this is\".",
		"Trumpist influencers have similarly suggested on social media and other outlets that Joe Biden, his family members, and other Democrats should face legal retribution.",
		"Others called for \"action\" against Bragg and other prosecutors investigating Trump's actions.",
		"There's something deeply perverse about claiming that a Trump prosecution is a political assault on the rule of law while simultaneously calling for explicitly political prosecutions in retaliation.",
		"But this is just another step in a long path for the Trumpist right.",
		"Trump has been demanding for years that his political opponents and investigatory foes be locked up.",
		"He said during the 2016 campaign that if he were elected, his opponent Hillary Clinton would \"be in jail\".",
		"Once in office, he echoed his Fox advisers by frequently calling for the prosecution and imprisonment of his perceived foes.",
		"Those demands came not only publicly, through his Twitter feed and other public channels, but in private meetings with high-ranking government officials.",
		"\"He was always telling me that we need to use the F.B.I. and I.R.S. to go after people — it was constant and obsessive and is just what he's claiming is being done to him now,\" former Trump White House chief of staff John Kelly told The New York Times."

		'Cheers and chants of "USA! USA!" greeted former President Donald Trump as he spoke to friends, family and all Americans who tuned in last night to hear his reaction to a legal case that even his detractors describe as flimsy.',
 'In what was essentially a campaign rally, the declared presidential candidate discussed the many ways Democrats have tried to undermine him with their "fraudulent investigations"; he called out his political enemies by name, including his latest nemesis, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg; he derided other, ongoing investigations into his activities; and he warned that "our country is going to hell" under President Joe Biden.',
 'Notably, CNN cut away from the speech about 23 minutes into it as Trump described "where we are as a nation".',
 'MSNBC refused to air the Trump speech, because, as Rachel Maddow put it, it was "basically a campaign speech in which he is repeating his same lies and allegations against his perceived enemies".',
 'Trump noted that "overall crime in New York was up 30 percent last year, much more than that the year before, with felony assaults, robberies and burglaries all up by massive, massive numbers -- not the same place that I know; not the same place that you know.',
 '“And this is where we are right now.',
 'I have a Trump-hating judge.',
 'With a Trump-hating wife and family.',
 'Whose daughter worked for Kamala Harris...”.',
 '"There is no case" "So here we are now,” Trump said, referring to his arraignment, where he pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records relating to a nondisclosure agreement and payment to a porn star in 2016.',
 'Trump said some of the threats made by prosecutors against people who work for him -- efforts to get them to testify against Trump -- are "right out of the old Soviet Union".',
 '"This is where we are as a nation," Trump said."',
'"Who would have thought, they can\'t beat us at the ballot box, so they try and beat us through the law. That\'s the country in which we live."', 
 '"However, right now the USA is a mess. Our economy is crashing. Inflation is out of control".',
 '"Russia has joined with China, can you believe that? Saudi Arabia has joined with Iran. China, Russia, Iran and North Korea have formed together as a menacing and destructive coalition.',
 'Would have never happened if I were your president, would never have happened. Nor would Russia attacking Ukraine have happened.',
 'All of those lives would be saved. All of those beautiful cities would be standing.',
 'Our currency is crashing and will soon no longer --" Here, CNN\'s Anderson Cooper cut in, turning to a panel of Trump haters for their predictable opinions of Trump reprising "pretty much every grievance," as Cooper put it.'],
